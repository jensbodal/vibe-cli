# Queue

This folder holds **activities**, the basic work units for this repository.

Each activity is stored in its own Markdown file named using the pattern:

```
activity-<timestamp>-<slug>.md
```

`<timestamp>` is the UTC time in `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` format. `<slug>` is a short
hyphenated description of twenty characters or fewer. Activities are the only
item type currently supported in the queue.
