# Evaluate example agent

Decide whether the repository should keep the `example` agent or remove it once real agents exist.

## Why keep an example agent
- Serves as a reference implementation for new contributors.
- Allows development and testing when no real agents are available.
- Demonstrates integration points for the CLI and library tooling.

## Criteria for inclusion or removal
- **Keep** the example agent while it is the only working agent or when onboarding requires a simple template.
- **Remove** it after a production-ready agent replaces it or if the example becomes confusing for users.
