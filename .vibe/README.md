The `.vibe` directory stores metadata and configuration generated by
agents during development. Files here are optional and may be ignored
by users not working with the agent tooling.

Open tasks are tracked in `.vibe/tasks.md` with additional details stored
under the `./tasks` folder. A catalog of projects and outstanding ideas
is maintained in `.vibe/projects.md`.
