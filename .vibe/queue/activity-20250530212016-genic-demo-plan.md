# Research and demo plan for Genic framework

This activity tracks the work required to research and demonstrate the "genic" framework using common machine learning libraries.

## Libraries

| Library | â‰¤8-word summary | URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TensorFlow / Keras | High-level deep learning; autoencoders, GANs, VAEs. | https://www.tensorflow.org/ |
| PyTorch | Research-friendly neural networks; flexible dynamic graphs. | https://pytorch.org/ |
| scikit-learn | Classical ML; t-SNE, clustering, metrics. | https://scikit-learn.org/ |
| Hugging Face Transformers | Pretrained transformer models, embeddings, fine-tuning. | https://huggingface.co/transformers/ |

## Next steps

1. Review each library's documentation.
2. Identify genic features or equivalents.
3. Prepare minimal demos using notebooks.
4. Document the findings.
