# Add TypeScript type packages

Add development dependencies for common type packages including `@types/node`, `@types/express`, `@types/react`, and `@types/react-dom`. Update the client application tsconfig to include DOM libraries so the React app compiles correctly.

## Notes

These dependencies were added to `package.json` under `devDependencies`. The React application's `tsconfig.app.json` now specifies `lib: ["DOM", "ESNext"]` so the compiler includes DOM types.
