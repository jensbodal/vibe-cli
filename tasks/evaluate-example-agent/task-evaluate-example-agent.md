# Evaluate example agent

Determine whether the repository should include an `example-agent` implementation or omit it entirely. Document the pros and cons and recommend next steps.

## Considerations
- Does an example agent help new developers understand how to build custom agents?
- Would maintaining a stub agent add overhead without much value?
- Should we provide a minimal reference agent or rely on documentation only?
