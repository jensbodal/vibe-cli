The `.vibe` directory stores metadata and configuration generated by
agents during development. Files here are optional and may be ignored
by users not working with the agent tooling.

Tasks are stored in `.vibe/tasks` following the conventions described in `AGENTS.md`:
- Simple tasks as `.vibe/tasks/<task-slug>.md`.
- Complex tasks requiring multiple sub-tasks or projects under `.vibe/tasks/<task-slug>/`.
See `AGENTS.md` for detailed guidelines.
